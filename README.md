## Employment History

### Common Code: Senior Software Engineer

Sept 2015 - present

Worked on various projects from e-commerce sites to front ends for medical devices.
Most of our projects are managed as agile (or at least striving to maintain some
sense of agility).  Typically we like to use our favourite components: Django with
Postgres (and Celery and/or Redis if needed) and React, Redux, Bootstrap and SASS
(using BEM).

During my time at Common Code I worked as a lead/senior frontend & backend developer
which meant being involved in the technology decision making process & teaching/mentoring
juniour developers.

#### Key Technologies:

React, Redux, Angular, Django, Hapi (Node), PostgreSQL, Celery, Redis, GraphQL, Relay, Bootstrap, SASS, BEM

### Freelancing, various clients

2011 - 2015

During this period I chose to freelance in order to allow myself some time to try and write
& sell my own products & services.  Although eventually unsuccessful at gaining any notable
traction with my own products, I did have an interesting time working on a few different paid projects.

The projects I worked on were either solo or in a small team.  I was responsible
for being both a business analyst (requirements discovery & management with the client)
and a software developer.

### Baseline Solutions, Senior Software Engineer
