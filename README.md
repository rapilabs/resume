## Employment History

### Common Code: Senior Software Engineer

Sept 2015 - April 2017

Worked on various projects from e-commerce sites to front ends for medical devices.
Most of our projects are managed as agile (or at least striving to maintain some
sense of agility).  Typically we like to use our favourite components: Django with
Postgres (and Celery and/or Redis if needed) and React, Redux, Bootstrap and SASS
(using BEM).

During my time at Common Code I worked as a lead/senior frontend & backend developer
which meant being involved in the technology decision making process & teaching/mentoring
junior developers.

#### Key Technologies:

React, Redux, Angular, Django, Hapi (Node), PostgreSQL, Celery, Redis, GraphQL, Relay, Bootstrap, SASS, BEM

   using React, Redux, Bootstrap & Django.
 - Frontend development for touchscreen for a medical device.  Implemented with Angular.


### Freelancing, various clients

2011 - 2015

for being both a business analyst (requirements discovery & management with the client)
